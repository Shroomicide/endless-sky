#  *  Notes on language style *
#  
#	1. 		When not explicitely using "he, him, her, etc." or situations in which the context implies only men or women, most "group" terms are used to inflect either gender.
#		This follows what I interpret as a continuation of the modern trend toward encompassing both genders into previously "male" or "female" terms. 
#		For example, "Lads" equates to a group of men, women, or men and women in the same way as "guys" or "dudes". It does not strictly imply males unless contextually specified. 
#		My intent is to provide thematic variability and allow conversations to flow naturally where NPCs would normally use the player character's gender 
#		(which the game does not know) without always using implied addresses or the handful of neutral addresses we currently have (you, <first>, Captain).
#

# # # # #  NOTES ON SYNTAX  # # # # #
#
#	1. Conversations
#		a. "meetupX" is a special label I use to keep conversations organized. These labels indicate the next spot where conversation threads meet back up, regardless of chosen options. They are numbered sequentially for ease-of-use.
#		b. You may notice "goto" markers just prior to the dialogue label they are meant to be paired with. This is to cut down on mistakes during editing / additions to conversations.
#		c. "branch" markers are linked to "branchX" labels to keep track of branch labels vs. regular dialogue labels vs. meetup labels.
#		d. "question" is a special label I use for certain missions where the player can ask a series of questions, but eventually has to say "yes" or "no". These are single-line recursive; they take up less space and do not visibly repeat in-game.

Banks are often made out to be the enemy, but historically speaking, banks have allowed private business to flourish by providing security, allowing for collective funding, and giving the average person a safety net without relying on the government or communal goodwill. Even if they do take certain excesses and breed financial corruption when not kept in check, they're a necessary institution for free trade in modern galactic society."`

How hard did you have to work? And now they're breaking your back for more - and interest! It's disgusting. Shouldn't there be a middle ground?"`

We front enough money to forgive their debt in return for a few deliveries, passenger runs, you get the gist. Sort of like a network of amateur couriers spread across the Republic."`

				`	"That sounds a lot like starport job postings. What's the difference?"`
				`	"So... Basically, private starport jobs. How does that work? What's the difference?"`

"The difference is, we have a reliable courier, so we can cut expenses, and you get paid up front, so your debt goes away - no loan interest spoiling every delivery you make. I mean, if you took out a 500,000 credit loan to buy your ship, that's over 295,000 credits in interest by the end of the year. And all that assuming the bank gave you a 'fair' 0.3% daily interest rate."`

Possession is nine-tenths of the law, after all. Best-case, you end up sucking recycled air in some prison station alongside a drop-off contact."`

Yeah, there's a lot of illegal stuff that's also wrong, but between illegal and immoral, there's a pretty gray line. Wrongfully-convicted criminals, untaxed goods for Dirt Belt workers, and whatever the Republic decides is evil tomorrow. You're sounding pretty high and noble up there. Let's wait until your family is dying of a Dirt Belt disease and the only medicine left to try has been outlawed."`
			`	She pauses a moment. "And of course, we also smuggle a lot of drugs, because who doesn't love 'em? And if you don't want to get involved, no one is forcing you. But if you have a change of heart for any reason, why don't you head on over to Earth?"`

			`	You hear a small metallic tap on the other end. "Well, now you know! And if you want to do more than imagine being in prison, why don't you head on over to Earth? We have plenty of work for our best couriers. Just kidding about the prison part - if you're smart, you'll never see the inside of a cell. But head to Earth if you're interested in doing a little more."`
