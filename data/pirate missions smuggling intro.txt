#	1. Conversations
#		a. "meetupX" is a special label I use to keep conversations organized. These labels indicate the next spot where conversation threads meet back up, regardless of chosen options. They are numbered sequentially for ease-of-use.
#		b. You may notice "goto" markers just prior to the dialogue label they are meant to be paired with. This is to cut down on mistakes during editing / additions to conversations.
#		c. "branch" markers are linked to "branchX" labels to keep track of branch labels vs. regular dialogue labels vs. meetup labels.
#		d. "questions" is a special label I use for certain missions where the player can ask a series of questions, but eventually has to say "yes" or "no". These are single-line recursive; they take up less space and do not visibly repeat in-game.

			`	A pleasant female voice interrupts your daydreaming. "Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. I did the same thing when I got my first ship." Beside you stands a remarkably beautiful woman in her mid-twenties; her long auburn hair falls in natural streaks and waves, framing a thin, pleasant face.`

That's a really impressive ship you've got there, captain. But you better run - it looks like they're taking off without you."`
			choice
				`	"What?"`
			`	The Firebird primes its thrusters, lifts off the pad, and launches away. You stand idly, dumbfounded at your poor luck.`
			`	"I guess they're coming back for you, right? You know, since you're the captain. Can't have a ship without a captain."`
			choice
				`	"That's right. They're just going on a pleasure cruise of sorts. While I take care of very important business here. Because I'm the captain."`
					goto business
				`	"It seems I've been caught. It was for a good cause, though!"`
			`	She laughs. "A good cause? What, trying to impress me?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes..."`
				`	"No..."`
			`	She grins and rolls her eyes. "That's really not necessary. It's impressive enough that you're out here, piloting your own ship and making your own way, even if it's not some big warship." She smiles at you. "Honestly."`
				goto meetup2

				goto meetup2
		
			label meetup2
			`	Her smile hangs for a moment, then turns to a sigh. "It's a real shame though, making new captains into paupers, just so the banks can make themselves rich off other people's hard work."`
			choice
				`	"I'm not sure about that. Banks are often made out to be the enemy, but historically speaking, banks have allowed private business to flourish by providing security, allowing for collective funding, and giving the average person a safety net without relying on the government or communal goodwill. Even if they do take certain excesses and breed financial corruption when not kept in check, they're a necessary institution for free trade in modern galactic society."`
				`	"You know, I think you're right. No matter how I look at it, the rise of centralized finance has led to an irrevocable disparity in individual wealth. Look at all the great financial disasters of the past - before 'credit' existed, wealth could only be measured locally. Loss of wealth in one region was balanced by gain in another. Now, how much is a building really 'worth'? How about a starship? Even a person? It's all relative, according to inscrutible finance on a galactic scale, and we're all just trying to keep up before our lives become worthless."`
					goto disparity
				`	"BURN THE BANKS!"`
					goto burn
				`	"I guess. I don't really have an opinion."`
					goto guess
			`	The woman appears genuinely surprised. "You might be right. But don't we have one of those excesses right here? How long did you have to dream about this moment before it became a reality? How hard did you have to work? And now they're breaking your back for more - and interest! It's disgusting. Shouldn't there be a middle ground?"`
				goto meetup3
			label guess
			`	The woman stares thoughtfully. "Temperance is a wonderful thing to have. But I wonder if that kind of uncertainty is what allows banks to exploit new pilots with so-called 'financial aid'."`
				goto meetup3
			label burn
			`	The woman laughs, then in a raucous tone responds, "A bonfire of banknotes! And kindling of the bankers! All debts forgiven!"`
				goto meetup3
			label disparity
			`	The woman nods. "That's a surprisingly detailed criticism. Most people who disagree with the private finance industry are far less eloquent. I think it might serve you well, once you get out from under your current obligation to it."`
			
			label meetup3
			`	You feel a small pang of nausea at the mention of your own outstanding debt. The woman offers a look of pity and understanding. "I'm sorry. No matter how you look at it, it's just not fair."`
			`	The woman looks around for a moment, then exclaims, "Oh! But I had a reason for all this, and believe it or not, it's related. Now that I've taken up so much of your time, let me introduce myself - my name is Alexandra Merrin. May I ask your name?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm <first> <last>."`

			`	"I'm a scout for a special courier firm. Basically, we look for new captains who bought their ships in debt, and are struggling to make due. We front enough money to forgive their debt in return for a few deliveries, passenger runs, you get the gist. Sort of like a network of amateur couriers spread across the Republic."`
			choice
				`	"That sounds a lot like spaceport job postings. What's the difference?"`
				`	"So, basically, private spaceport jobs. How does that work? What's the difference?"`
			`	Alexandra smiles knowingly. "The difference is, we have a reliable courier, so we can cut expenses, and you get paid up front, so your debt goes away - no loan interest spoiling every delivery you make. I mean, if you took out a 500,000 credit loan to buy your ship, that's over 295,000 credits in interest by the end of the year. And all that assuming the bank gave you a 'fair' 0.3% daily interest rate."`

"Well, we'll keep asking you, but if you aren't there when you're needed too often, we'll have to report you to the Republic for breaking contract and collect our 500,000 again. It should go without saying, but abandoning deliveries and missing deadlines is a big no-no. But you don't look like the type of person who would do that! So what do you say?"`
